    <h1>What are Revnets?</h1>
    <i>Adapted from <a href="https://revnet.eth.limo/">revnet.eth.limo</a>.</i>
    <p>
      <b>Revnets</b> are revenue-backed up-only networks, great for funding and
      sustaining open source projects and internet networks.
    </p>
    <h2>State of Internet Business</h2>
    <h4>
      Open source software and openly accounted-for businesses should
      outcompeting everything.
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Scaled Collaboration:</strong> Global community accelerates
          experimentation and innovation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Full Transparency:</strong> Public code and accounting foster
          trust and security.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Many managerial expenses are not
          needed when there are no secrets or artificial barriers to progress.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <h4>
      Open source struggles to enforce revenue-generation to pay for innovation,
      maintenance, and growth, making its development reliant on free and
      inconsistent labor, donations, grants, or corporate sponsorship.
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Monetization Dilemma:</strong> Generating scalable and
          unilateral revenue while keeping information openly copyable is
          fragile since extracting profit margins encourage the use of
          alternatives.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Value Dilemma:</strong> Conventional models fail to adequately
          and consistently reward all contributors, reducing incentive to
          participate on all fronts.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Dependency Dilemma:</strong> Many profitable businesses rely
          deeply on open source components, yet don't have clarity on how to
          foster a productive financial relationship with its community, or
          motivation to do so unless developed in-house.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <h4>
      Revnets: A win-win-win openly-accounted-for growth model, for investors,
      builders, and retail customers of open source and beyond. Powered by the
      Juicebox and Uniswap protocols, on Ethereum.
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Networks matter:</strong> The value around open source
          projects is created by the community of supporters that invest, build,
          and use them. Revnets take everyone's contribution into account,
          providing a structured yet open way to grow and sustain the project.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Revenue matters:</strong> People prefer to pay for and help
          projects when they love what it stands for and benefit from its
          growth. Revnets encourage the community to capture revenue, creating a
          self-fueling economy around the project.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Growth matters</strong>: With each generation of investors,
          builders, and users building upon the last, revnets foster a
          predictable and self-propagating growth model.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Incentives matter</strong>: By offering a structured
          revenue-backed growth model, revnets incentivize contributions from
          investors, builders, and users while providing clearity around
          financial relationships, making the open-source project more
          community-owned and less dependent on inconsistent external funding.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Investment &amp; Revenue Capture:</strong> When Revnets take
          in money, they issue out an option on that money to the payer, and
          possibly a little to a builder. This means each payer receives a
          rebate that increases in value as the network grows or shrinks,
          aligning the interests of all parties involved.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Scheduled Option Issuance:</strong> Fewer of these options get
          issued over time relative to the amount of money paid in, on a fixed
          schedule. This acknowledges the risks and contributions of earlier
          participants, increasing the value of existing options as new money
          comes in.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Option Exercise &amp; Value Appreciation:</strong> When the
          option is exercised, the remaining options become more valuable as the
          total pool of available options decreases. The revnet's money can only
          be accessed via these options, ensuring a controlled and incentivized
          access to the funds.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Market Dynamics:</strong> The options can be traded on
          exchanges, creating a market window between the ever-increasing price
          ceiling created by the price of issuing new options, and the
          ever-increasing price floor created by the value of exercising
          options. This market dynamic provides a tangible value proposition for
          initial and future investors, builders, and users.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A revnet's fiscal policy results in the chart shown above. There are only
      few immutable parameters tuned when a revnet is deployed which determine
      the rate of price ceiling increases as the issuance of options decreases,
      and the intensity of price floor increases as options are exercised.

    <h2>Why Bet On Revnets</h2>
    <p>
      Revnets tie the act of paying for a public product to both a moral and
      financial incentive. By paying into the revnet, individuals not only
      fulfill a required or voluntary debt to the project and its supporting
      community, they also create a means of benefiting from future payment.
      This dual incentive structure motivates communities to support its own
      growth instead of opting for free alternatives that struggle to find
      sustainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revnets are a clear, tangible, and equitable financial structure that
      address the long-standing monetization dilemma in open source, built
      specifically as an attractive model for networks of investors, builders,
      and fee-paying consumers alike.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
      Each Revnet issues its own token and accepts a specific currency, chosen
      when the revnet is created. Once a Revnet is created, all of its
      parameters are locked in place. To make things simpler, let's imagine
      ExampleNet, a revnet which accepts ETH and issues EXMP, an example
      token.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone can pay ExampleNet with ETH to create EXMP. The ETH price to create
      EXMP is the <strong>price ceiling</strong>. It costs 1 ETH to create 1
      EXMP at first, but EXMP gets more expensive over time, according to
      ExampleNet's increase frequency (how often the price ceiling increases)
      and its increase amount (how much the price ceiling increases).
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone can destroy their EXMP to reclaim some ETH from ExampleNet. The
      amount of ETH you can get back by destroying EXMP is the
      <strong>price floor</strong>. The price floor is calculated based on your
      portion of the total EXMP supply and the amount of ETH in ExampleNet.
      ExampleNet can also have a price floor tax which keeps some of the ETH
      which would be reclaimed in ExampleNet, raising the price floor. The price
      floor <i>also</i> increases when people pay ExampleNet over generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why Revnets are 'up-only' â€“ as long as network activity continues,
      the price floor should continue to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      ExampleNet will issue EXMP at the price ceiling until a Uniswap pool forms
      between EXMP and ETH. From that point onwards, while EXMP's Uniswap pool
      price is between the price ceiling and price floor, EXMP will be purchased
      and sold in that pool. If the EXMP price reaches the price ceiling or
      price floor, the EXMP supply will expand or contract to meet market
      demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ExampleNet can also set up a <strong>boost</strong> which sends a
      percentage of EXMP to a specific address (the boost operator) for a period
      of time after ExampleNet's creation. For example, a 20% boost which lasts
      100 days would send 20% of EXMP token purchases to the boost operator, but
      would stop sending these tokens after 100 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      ExampleNet can also pre-mint EXMP to the boost operator when ExampleNet is
      created. The boost operator could be a core team or developer multisig,
      but it could also be a staking rewards contract, an airdrop stockpile, or
      something else.
