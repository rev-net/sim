    <h1>About Revnets</h1>

    <p>
      Let's say you want to build an open-source alternative to Google Maps.
      Unless you want to build it by yourself, you'll need some type of
      organization.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Something like an LLC or a C corporation could work, but you would have
        to deal with legal fees, paperwork, and management. These structures
        make sense for working with shareholders and maximizing profits, but
        that isn't your goal.
      </li>
      <li>
        You could set up something more experimental like a DAO, but this comes
        with its own burdens – you have to figure out governance and onchain
        logistics to even get things off the ground, and DAOs have risks like
        governance takeovers that you don't want to deal with.
      </li>
      <li>
        You could try to make things work without a formal organization, but a
        lack of pre-determined rules and boundaries can lead to disputes later
        on.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Even if one of these options <em>did</em> work, how would you attract and
      grow a network of users to write reviews and label addresses?
    </p>
    <p>
      We ran into this exact problem when building our own software projects:
      Why isn't there a simple way to set up rules in advance, and automatically
      share money with a network of supporters as it comes in?
    </p>

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>
      To solve this, we're building "Revenue Networks" or <b>Revnets</b>, which
      are a new way to get your project off the ground and fairly share money
      with your entire network of investors, workers, and customers. Revnets are
      designed with a few key principles:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Anyone who supports a Revnet should get some of its revenue, whether
        they're a worker, an investor, or a customer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Revnet are owned by everyone in the network. Everyone interacts with a
        Revnet according to the same rules.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those rules should be set in place when the Revnet is created, and
        impossible to change afterwards. Money can only come into or leave the
        Revnet according to those rules, making scams and
        <a
          href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-rug-pull-how-to-protect-yourself-from-getting-rugged/"
          >rug pulls</a
        >
        impossible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anyone can make a Revnet and use it for whatever they want. Revnets
        shouldn't depend on us or third parties to work.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To accomplish this, we built Revnets using
      <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/">smart contracts</a> on
      Ethereum. This means projects don't have to depend on us or third parties,
      and makes it impossible to break the Revnet's rules as long as our
      contracts (and Ethereum) stay secure.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>How Revnets Actually Work</h2>
    <p>
      When you make a Revnet, you pick which currency you want it to accept.
      Since Revnets are built on Ethereum, ETH is the simplest option.<sup
        >2</sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      To represent ownership of the network (and a claim on some of its money),
      Revnets use tokens. Tokens are really just numbers stored on a smart
      contract – you can just as well think of these as "points", "credits", or
      "options".
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's return to our Google Maps alternative. We'll make a Revnet named
      <b>MapNet</b> which accepts ETH and uses MPN tokens to represent network
      ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone can pay MapNet with ETH to make new MPN. The price to make new MPN
      is also called the <strong>price ceiling</strong>. At first, it costs 1
      ETH to create 1 MPN, but MPN will get more expensive over time, depending
      on the price ceiling's <i>increase frequency</i> (how often the price
      increases) and its <i>increase amount</i> (how much the price increases).
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone can destroy their MPN to get back some ETH from MapNet. The amount
      of ETH you can get back is also called the
      <strong>price floor</strong>. In the most basic scenario, if you have 1%
      of the total number of MPN tokens and destroy them, you get back 1% of
      MapNet's ETH.
    </p>
    <p>
      MapNet can also have a price floor tax, which means you would get back
      less than 1% of MapNet's ETH. That ETH would stay in MapNet, raising the
      price floor for everyone else. The price floor also increases as it gets
      more expensive to make new MPN (as long as people keep making it). This is
      why Revnets are 'up-only' – as long as network activity continues, the
      price floor should continue to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      MapNet will make MPN at the price ceiling until a
      <a
        href="https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/8829880740109-What-is-a-liquidity-pool-"
        >Uniswap pool</a
      >
      (trading market) forms between MPN and ETH. From that point onwards, while
      MPN's pool price is between the price ceiling and price floor, MPN will be
      purchased and sold in that pool. If MPN's pool price reaches the price
      ceiling or price floor, the MPN supply will grow or shrink to meet demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      To boost early growth, MapNet can set up a
      <strong>boost</strong>. A boost sends some MPN to a wallet address called
      the <i>boost operator</i> for some time after MapNet is created. For
      example: "for the first 100 days, when people buy MPN, send 10% of it to
      our developer team's wallet".
    </p>
    <p>
      MapNet can also pre-mint some MPN to that address when MapNet is created.
      The address could be a core team or developer multisig, but it could also
      be a staking rewards contract, an airdrop stockpile, or something else.
    </p>

    <h2>Why it Works</h2>
    <p>Revnets work very well for a project like MapNet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        MapNet development needs some heavy lifting up front to get the basics
        working – the boost (and pre-mint) can be used to encourage early work
        from a team of developers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because MPN gets more expensive over time, early MapNet supporters will
        have more of an incentive to leave reviews, label addresses, and use the
        platform. If it grows, they win too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because of the price floor, the tokens can never lose all of their
        value. This makes Revnets safer to participate in.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But you need to be careful. If your boost or pre-mint is too large, it
      might feel unfair and make people less likely to support your Revnet. If
      the price increases too quickly, it might cause liquidity issues later on.
      To get a sense of how these options play out, experiment with the
      <a href="/">Revnet simulator</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think that Revnets will work best for open-source software, social
      networks, and platforms which rely on user-generated content, but Revnets
      can work for all kinds of applications. If you want to talk through your
