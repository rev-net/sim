    <h1>About Revnets</h1>

    <p>
      Let's say you want to build an open-source alternative to Google Maps.
      Unless you want to build it by yourself, you'll need some type of
      organization.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Something like an LLC or a C corporation could work, but you would have
        to deal with legal fees, paperwork, and management. These structures
        make sense for working with shareholders and maximizing profits, but
        that isn't your goal.
      </li>
      <li>
        You could set up something more experimental like a DAO, but this comes
        with its own burdens – you have to figure out governance and onchain
        logistics to even get things off the ground, and DAOs have risks like
        governance takeovers that you don't want to deal with.
      </li>
      <li>
        You could try to make things work without a formal organization, but a
        lack of pre-determined rules and boundaries can lead to disputes later
        on.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Even if one of these options <em>did</em> work, how would you attract and
      grow a network of users to write reviews and label addresses?
    </p>
    <p>
      We ran into this exact problem when building our own software projects:
      Why isn't there a simple way to set up rules in advance, and automatically
      share money with a network of supporters as it comes in?
    </p>

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>
      To solve this, we're building "Revenue Networks" or <b>Revnets</b>, which
      are a new way to get your project off the ground and fairly share money
      with your entire network of investors, workers, and customers. Revnets are
      designed with a few key principles:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Anyone who supports a Revnet should get some of its revenue, whether
        they're a worker, an investor, or a customer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Revnet are owned by everyone in the network. Everyone interacts with a
        Revnet according to the same rules.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those rules should be set in place when the Revnet is created, and
        impossible to change afterwards. Money can only come into or leave the
        Revnet according to those rules, making scams and
        <a

          >rug pulls</a
        >
        impossible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anyone can make a Revnet and use it for whatever they want. Revnets
        shouldn't depend on us or third parties to work.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To accomplish this, we built Revnets using
      <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/">smart contracts</a> on
      Ethereum. This means projects don't have to depend on us or third parties,
      and makes it impossible to break the Revnet's rules as long as our
      contracts (and Ethereum) stay secure.<sup>3</sup>
    </p>

    <h2>How Revnets Actually Work</h2>
    <!-- <p>
      When you make a Revnt
    </p>
    <p>
      Revnets use tokens to represent a portion of revenue. Tokens are really
      just numbers stored on a smart contract – you can think of these as
      "points", "credits", or something else if it makes this easier.
    </p> -->
    <p>
      Each Revnet issues its own token and accepts a currency, chosen when the
      Revnet is created. Revnets don't have owners, and their rules are can't be
      changed. To make things simpler, let's imagine ExampleNet, a Revnet which
      issues its own EXMP token and accepts ETH.<sup>2</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone can pay ExampleNet with ETH to create EXMP. The price to create
      EXMP is the <strong>price ceiling</strong>. It costs 1 ETH to create 1
      EXMP at first, but EXMP will get more expensive over time, depending on
      ExampleNet's increase frequency (how often the price ceiling increases)
      and its increase amount (how much the price ceiling increases).
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone can destroy their EXMP to get back some ETH from ExampleNet. The
      amount of ETH you can get back by destroying EXMP is the
      <strong>price floor</strong>, which is based on your portion of the total
      EXMP supply and the amount of ETH in ExampleNet. ExampleNet can also have
      a price floor tax which keeps some of the ETH which would be reclaimed in
      ExampleNet, raising the price floor for future reclaimers. The price floor
      also increases as people buy EXMP over time (because it gets more
      expensive).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why Revnets are 'up-only' – as long as network activity continues,
      the price floor should continue to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      ExampleNet will issue EXMP at the price ceiling until a Uniswap pool forms
      between EXMP and ETH. From that point onwards, while EXMP's Uniswap pool
      price is between the price ceiling and price floor, EXMP will be purchased
      and sold in that pool. If the EXMP price reaches the price ceiling or
      price floor, the EXMP supply will expand or contract to meet market
      demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ExampleNet can also set up a <strong>boost</strong> which sends a some
      EXMP to a wallet address (the boost operator) for some time after
      ExampleNet's creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ExampleNet can pre-mint some EXMP to the boost operator when ExampleNet is
      created. The boost operator could be a core team or developer multisig,
      but it could also be a staking rewards contract, an airdrop stockpile, or
      something else.
